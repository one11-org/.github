# Contributing to One11 Projects
We want to make contributing to One11 projects as easy and transparent as possible.

## Development
All changes happen through pull requests. Pull requests are the best way to propose changes. Please note that some conventions here might be different than what you are used to. Reading this document will help you save time and work effectively with the developers at One11. Please refer to [DEVELOPMENT.md](https://github.com/one11-org/.github/blob/main/DEVELOPMENT.md) for more info.

## Issues
We use GitHub issues to track all public bugs. Please search existing issues and create a new one if the issue is not yet tracked. Please ensure your description is clear and has sufficient instructions to be able to reproduce the issue.

One11 has a [bounty program](https://github.com/one11-org/.github/blob/main/SECURITY.md) for the safe disclosure of security bugs. In those cases, please go through the process outlined on that page and do not file a public issue on GitHub.
